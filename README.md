# OC-Blender-Helper-Addon

A helper addon for Octane Blender edition

> **[New] WIP on a completely new and powerful tool for Blender & OC Blender users. See you soon**



> The reason I develop this addon is for speeding up user workflow, so users can access basic functions provided by Octane very quickly and newcomers can know where to start. The materials and their nodes setup are pretty rough and use them as a starting point

> I welcome issue reports, please let me know where to promote and fix

## Installation

* Preferences > Add-ons > Install
* Select **Octane_Helper.zip** to install
  * Please do not install the zip from the downloaded repository named OC-Blender-Helper-Addon-master.zip
* Activate it
  * If you have installed the addon, please restart your Blender

## Questions
* When should I use Update display settings under Environment menu?
  * In any new project, you should click that button once to update current display settings because by default Octane Blender has a wrong setup for display device
* Cannot insert keyframes from UI panels
  * We cannot insert keyframes and click file selector eyedropper from panels yet because of a known bug in Blender build, which will be fixed in future builds
* Megascans Livelink module does not respond to imports
  * Check the log to see the error
  * Some assets' meshes cannot be imported due to issues with built-in fbx/obj importer, which will be fixed in the future
  * Starting from 2020, when you first time launch the Bridge App and click the "Download Plugin", it automatically puts an addon that occupies the port at startup into C:\Users\\[Your username]\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.8[X]\scripts\startup. It's called "MSPlugin", please remove the folder and restart the Blender
  * There is no switch button for the official quixel addon, so if you want to use the addon for cycles/eevee again, just simply reinstall the offical addon then the octane megascans module will keep silent
* Wrong nodes setup with any material created from Right-Click Menu or Megascans module
  * For example, duplicated shader nodes without output node
  * Starting from Blender_Octane_Edition_2020.1.3_21.9_stable, there is a small difference when setting up materials. If you have to use previous versions, please use addons before 2.7.4
* Other issues
  * Please check the log from Blender > Top Bar > Window > Toggle System Console and let me know what's happening
